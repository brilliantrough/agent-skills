# Platform Environment Skill Audit

Use this skill before sharing a machine-specific accelerator skill or cluster
runbook with another user or host.

## Audit scope

Inspect the skill, every file it links to, and the commands it asks an agent to
run. Separate portable guidance from local facts.

Search for:

- personal usernames, initials, home directories, repositories, branches, and
  experiment names;
- absolute data, checkpoint, result, cache, Conda, Toolkit, and runtime paths;
- hostnames, IP addresses, ports, mount names, account names, and scheduler
  partitions;
- credentials, tokens, proxy URLs, private package indexes, and shell history;
- validation outputs that expose PIDs, job names, model names, or private data;
- claims copied from another host without a current-host validation date.

## Classification

Classify each fact as one of:

```text
portable       valid for any supported installation
local-platform valid only for the named host or homogeneous host class
workload       belongs to one repository or experiment
sensitive      must not be published
```

Portable skills should use placeholders for user and storage roots. Local
skills may name the host and paths, but must say so in the description and must
not claim that another host has the same state. Workload details belong in the
project, not in a platform skill.

## Required checks

1. Search recursively for old storage roots, usernames, hostnames, credentials,
   and copied validation dates.
2. Resolve symlinks and report broken or cross-user targets.
3. Verify every advertised path exists on the intended host.
4. Confirm package, driver, Toolkit, library, and Python versions live.
5. Distinguish installation success, native linking, single-device compute,
   collectives, and application validation.
6. Remove secrets rather than masking only their display.
7. Re-run the search after editing and report remaining intentional local facts.

Do not rewrite a local skill into vague portable advice when the local facts are
its purpose. Instead, keep a portable install skill and a clearly named local
platform skill with explicit ownership boundaries.
